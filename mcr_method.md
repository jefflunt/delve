# How to create a (M)inimal, (C)omplete, (R)eproducible example

When asking a debugging question, someone will be better able to provide help if
you provide code as text in your question that prospective answerers can easily
understand and use to reproduce the problem.

This boils down to ensuring you have included code in your question that follows
the guidelines below.

## Minimal:

Use as little code as possible that still produces the same problem. Sometimes
it's helpful to provide a simplified example that can still demonstate the
issue.

## Complete:

Provide all parts that someone else unfamiliar with your problem would need in
order to reproduce your problem in the question itself

## Reproducible:

Test the code you're about to provide to make sure it reproduces the problem The
rest of this help article provides guidance on these aspects of writing a
minimal, reproducible example.
